# How to contribute

If you want to add a domain, add the below lines to `domain-list.yml` in the following format:

```yaml
- domain: 'example.com'
  evidence: https://example.com/12345/best-10-contents-in-2022
```

The corresponding changes in `uBlacklist.txt` and `evidence.md` will be automatically regenerated by GitHub Actions
when PRs get merged.

## How to determine whether to accept

We use the following criteria to determine if we should add a new domain to the exclusion list.

- The domain consists of multiple occurrences of "Top N of ...", "Best N of ..." or similar ranking type contents.
- Such contents only provide brief description, image, and affiliate links to Amazon and/or any EC sites.

The below image illustrates how such contents look alike.

## Japanese-contents only?

Though this exclusion list is initially created for Japanese websites,
domains in other languages are also welcome.


## "I do not think this domain should be excluded"

We may exclude a new domain regardless it consists of other useful contents.
Since uBlacklist offers "allow-list" mechanism, users can allow some domains to be displayed regardless of exclusion lists.
